# 🧮 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A **Pygame-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using Python. This project visually demonstrates how sorting algorithms work in real-time using bars to represent array elements.

---

## 📌 Features

- Visualizes sorting using **bars of varying height**
- Supports:
  - 🔵 Bubble Sort
  - 🟢 Insertion Sort
- Real-time controls to toggle sort direction
- Gradient bar coloring for better UI distinction

## 🕹 Controls

| Key            | Action                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `R`            | Reset the list                         |
| `SPACE`        | Start sorting (uses selected algorithm)|
| `B + SPACE`    | Select Bubble Sort and start           |
| `I + SPACE`    | Select Insertion Sort and start        |
| `A`            | Sort in Ascending Order                |
| `D`            | Sort in Descending Order               |

## ⚙️ How It Works

- A randomly generated list of integers is visualized.
- Each bar's height corresponds to its value.
- The sorting algorithm animates each step.
- Sorting can be done in **ascending** or **descending** order.
